# Symmetric sipherer

This is a college project, made in 2016.
  
The aim of this project is the study of symmetric cryptography. Implemented in Java, this project makes it possible to test the Cesar and Vernam algorithm. It also makes it possible to do a simple analysis of a text, encrypted or not.
  
Another objective of this project is to make the code available for consultation, as it is a code made in a school environment, it is not properly standardized. Whether with English text, correctly separated the layers of the MVC project, there is also a lot of code smell.


## How to run
In 2021, the project was refactored to run on Java 8.

A priori, just run the project in a Java IDE, and place the cipher and key files in the project's root folder.
